-- Column names _geoloc.lng and _geoloc.lat are special. csvtojson understands to convert this to
-- "_geoloc":{"lng":-122.724,"lat":49.110044}. The --colParser option define the lat and long to be
-- numbers, rather than strings. With the special names _geoloc, lng and lat, Algolia understands
-- this to mean a geolocation point.
